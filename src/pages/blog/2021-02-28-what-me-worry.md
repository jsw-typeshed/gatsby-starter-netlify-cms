# Change is opportunity.
I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! No. We're on the top. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! We're also Santa Claus!

You lived before you met me?! Then we'll go with that data file! We're rescuing ya. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.

Oh yeah, good luck with that. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Bender, we're trying our best.

## The first time.

Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.

That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Professor, make a woman out of me. Why would a robot need to drink?

## The second time
Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. She also liked to shut up! Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.

### The third level
I can explain. It's very valuable. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. I'm Santa Claus! Leela's gonna kill me.

It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
